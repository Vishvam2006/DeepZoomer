# Deep Zoomer

Deep Zoomer is a web application built for the NASA Hackathon challenge "Embiggen Your Eyes!". It allows users to explore massive, high-resolution NASA images, zooming in and out to examine intricate details. Users can label known features and discover new patterns in space imagery, making even the largest datasets accessible and interactive. The UI is built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui components, with easy development and deployment using Vite.
